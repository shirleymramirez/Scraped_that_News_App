# Scraped_that_News_App
A web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news using Mongoose and Cheerio packages

## A Node.js & MongoDB webapp that web-scrapes news data from www.azcentral.com and allows users to comment about what they have read. Users can also delete unwanted comments.

Please check out the deployed version in Heroku https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/evening-stream-73257!

## The user first clicks the Scrape New Article! button to scrape www.azcentral.com, and it will populate with news article. Screenshot sample below:

Once, user click save button, it will automatically be saved in the save articles section. User will need to click that button to see all the saved articles.

In the Saved Articles section, user can add notes to specific articles and save the their comments, or delete.(I am still working on this functionality- saving notes to the server)

Lastly, user had the option of deleting the article in the saved article section too. Done, with it, working perfectly.

UI, design is not yet polished though.
